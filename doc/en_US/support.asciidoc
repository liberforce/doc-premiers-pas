=== Support requests (or ticket)

[IMPORTANT]
Be careful  any support request requires having an account on the market.

If you have not found a solution to your problem, you may as a last resort to a support request to Jeedom team this application requires a ticket. It is possible to open one of several ways: 

- Directly from Jeedom (recommended method): wherever you are in Jeedom, there is an upper right exclamation point which allows a support request

- If for whatever reason you do not have access to your Jeedom, you can always open a ticket from the market: either with the exclamation mark at the top right or by going to your profile (click the "Open a support request" button)

The rest of exchanges will be by email.
