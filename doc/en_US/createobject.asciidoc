You will create your first object here, but first you have to know what an object, it can be in Jeedom everything is anything but it is recommended to do so according to your room

[TIP]
You can define relationships between objects, eg the living room up to the ground floor object that belongs to the same object house

To create an object is simple, go to General -> Object
