If you have a service pack Jeedom puts at your disposal a direct access URL to your Jeedom without you having to open ports on your box or otherwise.

To configure simply go to General -> Administration -> Configuration

Once here you just have to activate "Use Jeedom DNS" then on the "management" to "Restart" and your URL will appear at http status, you can customize the course from the profile page market
